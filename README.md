Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

  This project implements a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. The chatbot uses if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This task aims to demonstrate knowledge of natural language processing and conversation flow.
  
  To run the chatbot:

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Execute the Python script that contains the chatbot implementation.
    Start interacting with the chatbot by typing messages.
    The chatbot will respond based on the predefined rules and patterns until you choose to exit.

Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
  
  This project implements an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI agent uses the Minimax algorithm with optional Alpha-Beta Pruning to ensure optimal gameplay and make the AI player unbeatable. This task aims to demonstrate knowledge of game theory and basic search algorithms.
  
  To run the game:

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Execute the Python script that contains the Tic-Tac-Toe AI implementation.
    Follow the prompts to make your moves by entering the row and column numbers (1-indexed).
    The AI will make its moves using the Minimax algorithm with optional Alpha-Beta Pruning.
    The game continues until one player wins or it ends in a draw.
